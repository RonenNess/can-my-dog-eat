			<h1 class="title">Can My Dog Eat...</h1> 
			<h2 style="font-size:150%; text-align: center;">Welcome to the full list of foods dogs should and shouldn't eat! Simple, long, and printer-friendly!</h2>
			<br />
			<p>The following is a list of foods that are safe / bad for your dog.<br />
			
			Regardless the list below, you should always follow these guidelines when giving your dog food for humans:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Always watch out for salt, sugar, artificial sweeteners and edible colors, which are very bad for dogs (more than for humans).</li>
				<li>If you're not sure about something - better be safe than sorry, just don't give it to your dog.</li>
				<li>Just because something is generally safe it doesn't mean your dog isn't alergic to it. When you give your dog something for the first time always in start with small quantities and monitor his behavior after.</li>
				<li>Usually if its bad for you its also bad for your dog (don't give your dog something you wouldn't eat). However, just because something is good for you doesn't mean its safe for your dog.</li>
				<li>For fruit and vegetables generally avoid things like pits, cores, seeds, rind, leaves, stems and skins. Those tend to be bad.</li>
				<li>Avoid things in shapes and textures that can choke your dog or create intestinal blockage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Disclaimer: I am not a vet. I just did an online research for my own dog and decided to share it with the world. If you find a mistake or have something to add, please contact me at <a href="mailto:ronenness@gmail.com">ronenness@gmail.com</a>. To be sure, its recommended to double check with google.</p>
